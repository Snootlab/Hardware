Hardware files and pictures of our products

Snootlab as member since 2011 of the Open Source Hardware World Association released most of our DIY products under GNU GPL v3 licence.

You'll find here useful files and pictures for most of our products. Sometimes BOM is missing and will do best effort in order to upload it later.

Enjoy Open Source Hardware !
